# Payment-Gateway-Integration

Key Components of Payment Gateway Integration:

HTML Form: An HTML form is designed to capture essential payment details from customers, such as the amount to be paid, contact information, and any other required fields.

CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the HTML form and ensure a consistent, attractive appearance that aligns with your website's branding. Styling elements such as buttons, input fields, and labels create a visually pleasing and cohesive user interface.

Razorpay Integration: JavaScript and Razorpay's API are employed to handle the payment processing. The integration involves generating a payment request and embedding a payment button or form into your HTML using Razorpay's provided code snippets.

Event Handling: JavaScript code manages user interactions, such as clicking the payment button, submitting the form, and handling responses from Razorpay's API. Event listeners trigger the necessary actions to initiate and complete the payment transaction.

Feedback and Confirmation: After a successful payment, JavaScript can be used to display confirmation messages or redirect users to a thank-you page. Similarly, in case of failed transactions, informative messages can guide users on resolving the issue.
